# Random Password Generator Challenge
## Project Description
This is a project that takes password generator starter code and expands on it to be able to, upon button click, present the user with a series of prompts/questions and, based on the answers provided, delivers (generates & displays) a random password inclusive of the user-provided criteria.

## Motivation
This is Challenge 3 in the UC Berkeley coding bootcamp.
